Experimentation:
https://github.com/janwilmake/routed-workers

Imagine this: a zero-config static worker with several mini-workers with automatic bindings.

A worker-js file would take the path of the name of the worker with wildcard.

Nice to have?

- truly OSS by design?
- fast partial redeployment?
- worker files can import/require frontend js files, and vice versa
